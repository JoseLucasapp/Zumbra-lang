# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of the Zumbra community pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Offering constructive feedback
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — including the repository, issues, pull requests, and community chats — and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at **[jlgf.profissional@gmail.com](mailto:jlgf.profissional@gmail.com)**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of the reporter.
